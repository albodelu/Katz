/**
 * Trampoline is often used to emulate tail recursion. The idea is to have some step code that can be trampolined itself
 * to emulate recursion. The difference with standard recursion would be that there is no need to rewind the whole stack
 * when we reach the end of the stack, since the first value returned that is not a trampoline would be directly
 * returned as the overall result value for the whole function chain. That means Trampoline emulates what tail recursion
 * does.
